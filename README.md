# Objective-C Learning Resources

[Objective-C](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html) was the primary programming language used for writing software for macOS and iOS until [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) was introduced in 2014. It is a superset of the C programming language and provides object-oriented capabilities and a dynamic runtime.

# Objective-C Tools, Libraries and Frameworks

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) includes everything developers need to create great applications for Mac, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, and Apple Watch. Xcode provides developers a unified workflow for user interface design, coding, testing, and debugging.

[AppKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit) is a graphical user interface toolkit that contains all the objects you need to implement the user interface for a macOS app such as windows, panels, buttons, menus, scrollers, and text fields, and it handles all the details for you as it efficiently draws on the screen, communicates with hardware devices and screen buffers, clears areas of the screen before drawing, and clips views.

[Instruments](https://help.apple.com/instruments/mac/current/#/dev7b09c84f5) is a powerful and flexible performance-analysis and testing tool that’s part of the Xcode tool set. It’s designed to help you profile your iOS, watchOS, tvOS, and macOS apps, processes, and devices in order to better understand and optimize their behavior and performance. 

[Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C in your Xcode projects by specifying the dependencies for your project in a simple text file. CocoaPods then recursively resolves dependencies between libraries, fetches source code for all dependencies, and creates and maintains an Xcode workspace to build your project. 

[AppCode](https://www.jetbrains.com/objc/) is constantly monitoring the quality of your code. It warns you of errors and smells and suggests quick-fixes to resolve them automatically. AppCode provides lots of code inspections for Objective-C, Swift, C/C++, and a number of code inspections for other supported languages.

[Realm](https://github.com/realm/realm-cocoa) is a mobile database(replaces Core Data & SQLite) that runs directly inside phones, tablets or wearables.

[Infer](https://github.com/facebook/infer) is a static analysis tool for Java, C++, Objective-C, and C.

[Mantle](https://github.com/Mantle/Mantle) is a model framework that makes it easy to write a simple model layer for your Cocoa or Cocoa Touch application.

[Quick](https://github.com/Quick/Quick) is a behavior-driven development framework for Swift and Objective-C. 

[Aspects](https://github.com/steipete/Aspects) is a simple library for aspect oriented programming in Objective-C and Swift.

[Hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon) is a tool for powerful automation for macOS that acts as a bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine.

[Nimbus](https://github.com/jverkoey/nimbus) is an iOS framework whose feature set grows only as fast as its documentation.
